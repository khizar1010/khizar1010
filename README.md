I’m Khizar Abidi, a graduate of BE in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NED University of Engineering and Technology, with a CGPA of 3.47/4 and IELTS band 6.5.

 

I worked as an R&D Engineer in the Research and Development Department in Zainergy (https://zainergy.com/#home) for providing IoT solutions to industries
and households like wireless control of electronic appliances, wireless data transferred in M5Stack, Device Management, Data Collection, Processing, Visualization,
and Smart Monitoring (using ESP32 and M5stack).

 

Currently, I'm doing a job as a software Engineer in Winson Technologies UK (https://www.winson-edu.uk/) and working on Different projects related to ESP32 IoT devices
for wireless camera control and their object detections using Python Library.

 

Before this I was engaging as a Research Assistant in SMART INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY,  my main research goal was to work on crack detection and working
on structural health monitoring. I was working on HRNet for semantic segmentation for crack detection (deep Learning). I also used Image processing to detect a crack
in road surfaces and walls by working on a deep neural network
